## Spring Boot Native microservice to manage clustered Quartz Jobs.

* **Level**: Advanced.
* **Technologies**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring Native, Spring WebFlux, Spring OAuth, Quartz, Flyway, Testcontainers, Postgres, DynamoDB and Docker Compose.


## Description.
This project uses the Spring Boot Framework to manage Quartz Jobs in a Spring Native microservice with the use of reactive programing using Spring WebFlux.
The Quartz library is configured for clustered environments, so its needs the help of Postgres database to manage the cron Jobs execution. 
When a Job is executed, the calling method retrieves the Device item from DynamoDB to change its state. 
To perform these activities, the users must be logged into the OIDC Service that its deployed using the AWS Cognito service.
All test cases using the TDD methodology from the beginning of the development phase, and only Integration Tests are executed with the support of Testcontainers because Unit Testing does not cover real world scenarios.
This project also uses Docker Compose to deploy a local cluster alongside the other required services by the Spring Boot application.

## Running using Docker Compose.
Only need to execute the following command from the project's root folder:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Getting Device items from DynamoDB on LocalStack.
Execute the following command:
```bash
aws dynamodb scan         \
  --table-name Devices    \
  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566
```

## Running using the Native Executable.
Use this option if you want to explore more features such as running your tests in a native image.
*IMPORTANT:* The GraalVM `native-image` compiler should be installed and configured on your machine.

Deploy the required services using Docker Compose command:
```bash
docker compose up tasks-postgres tasks-localstack
```

Open a new terminal window and export the following environment variables:
```bash
export HIPERIUM_CITY_TASKS_DB_CLUSTER_SECRET='{"dbClusterIdentifier":"hiperium-city-tasks-db-cluster","password":"postgres123","dbname":"HiperiumCityTasksDB","engine":"postgres","port":5432,"host":"localhost","username":"postgres"}'
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-southeast-2
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=DUMMY
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=DUMMY
export AWS_ENDPOINT_OVERRIDE=http://localhost:4566
```

Then, create and run the native executable from the project's root directory:
```bash
$ ./mvnw clean native:compile -Pnative spring-boot:run
```

## GraalVM Native Support
This project has been configured to let you generate either a lightweight container or a native executable.
It is also possible to run your tests in a native image.

### Lightweight Container with Cloud Native Buildpacks
If you're already familiar with Spring Boot container images support, this is the easiest way to get started.
Docker should be installed and configured on your machine prior to creating the image.

To create the image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app like any other container:

```
$ docker run --rm city-tasks-spring-boot-oauth2:1.4.0
```

### Executable with Native Build Tools
Use this option if you want to explore more options such as running your tests in a native image.
The GraalVM `native-image` compiler should be installed and configured on your machine.

**NOTE:** GraalVM 22.3+ is required.

To create the executable, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw native:compile -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app as follows:
```
$ target/city-tasks-spring-boot-oauth2
```

You can also run your existing tests suite in a native image.
This is an efficient way to validate the compatibility of your application.

To run your existing tests in a native image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw test -PnativeTest
```
